[![Support Ukraine Badge](https://bit.ly/support-ukraine-now)](https://github.com/support-ukraine/support-ukraine)

This plugin is used to authenticate in Redmine through an OAuth provider.

The user is identified by the email or login registered with the OAuth provider. The email or must match an email or 
login registered in Redmine. If such an email or login is not found, the user will be offered to register in Redmine, 
depending on Redmine's setting **Self-registration**. OAuth logout is also supported, if it is set in the options.
Access to Redmine can be controlled by roles assigned in your OAuth provider.
See [#36](https://github.com/kontron/redmine_oauth/issues/36#issuecomment-2348842432) for details; as well as OAuth 
autologin.

Inspired by Gucin's plugin https://github.com/Gucin/redmine_omniauth_azure.

### Registration

Register your Redmine instance as an application with your OAuth provider. Follow the instructions given on their 
websites. Add `https://yourdomain/oauth2callback` as redirect URI.

### Configuration

Open _Administration -> Plugins_ in your Redmine and configure the plugin.

Examples:

#### Provider Azure AD

* Site: https://login.microsoftonline.com
* Client ID: `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`
* Client secret: `xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`
* Tenant ID / Realm `xxxxxxxx-xxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`

#### Provider GitHub

* Site: https://github.com
* Client ID: `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`
* Client secret: `xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`

#### Provider Google

* Site: https://accounts.google.com
* Client ID: `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`
* Client secret: `xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`

#### Provider Keycloak

Create a new OIDC Client in your Keycloak Realm. Activate `Client authentication`.

* Site: `https://keycloak.example.com` (without any paths)
* Client-ID: `keycloak.example.com` (do not include `https://` or other special characters in the Client ID)
* Secret: Copy the client secret from Keycloak
* Tenant ID: the name of your Keycloak realm

### Tasks

#### Receive IMAP
Read emails from an IMAP server and process them into Redmine.

Available options:
* host - IMAP server [outlook.office365.com]
* port - Port [993]
* scope - Scope ['https://outlook.office365.com/.default']
* grant_type - Grant type ['client_credentials']
* ssl - use SSL [true]
* starttls - Start TLS [false]
* username - Login ['']     
* folder - Mail folder to scan [INBOX]
* move_on_success - Where to move successfully processed messages [nil]
* move_on_failure - Where to move unsuccessfully processed messages [nil]

Example:

```shell
rake redmine_oauth:email:receive_imap username='notifications@example.com' RAILS_ENV="production"
```

**Prior to accessing IMAP via OAuth, it is necessary to grant flow to authenticate IMAP connections.**

Here is a procedure how to do that in Azure:

### Uninstallation

```shell
cd plugins
rm -r redmine_oauth
```
Then restart the application/web server.
